# vg-gardner-fit

this work is initiated from the co-work proposed by Dr. HS Suk
purpose fit gardener equation to van Genuchten which is not applicable to most analytic solutions.

I originally try to make a subroutine fit gardner parameters to VG parameters using some optimization technique. 
But during a short research on google lead me to a paper writtne by Ghezzehei et al., 2007 WRR, which already addresses all problems that I have and looks treated in a right way.

So the routine will be just utilizing equations suggested by this paper.
